<P>The decision to effect the Partition of Bengal was announced on 7 July 1905 <IMG src = "BengalPartition1905.png" align = "right">by the Viceroy of India, Lord 
Curzon. The partition took place on 16 October 1905 and separated the largely Muslim eastern areas from the largely Hindu western areas. The Hindus of West Bengal who 
dominated Bengal's business and rural life complained that the division would make them a minority in a province that would incorporate the province of Bihar and 
Orissa.Hindus were outraged at what they recognised as a "divide and rule" policy, where the colonisers turned the native population against itself in order to rule, 
even though Curzon stressed it would produce administrative efficiency. The partition animated the Hindus and led the Muslims to form their own national organization 
on communal lines. Bengal was reunited by Lord Hardinage in 1911 in an effort to appease Bengali sentiment. It was reunited for the following reasons: 1. Swadeshi 
movement riots protested against it. Hindus thought the east bengal would have their own courts and policies.</P><BR><BR><BR><BR>
<P> Widespread agitation ensued in the streets and in the press, and the Congress advocated 
boycotting<IMG src ="Curzon.jpg" align = "right"> British products under the banner of swadeshi, or indigenous industries. A growing 
movement emerged, focussing on indigenous Indian industries, finance and education, which saw 
the founding of National Council of Education, birth of Indian financial institutions and banks, 
as well as an interest in Indian culture and achievements in science and literature. Hindus showed 
unity by tying Rakhi on each other's wrists and observing Arandhan (not cooking any food). During 
this time, Bengali Hindu nationalists like Sri Aurobindo, Bhupendranath Datta, and Bipin Chandra Pal 
began writing virulent newspaper articles challenging legitimacy of British rule in India in 
publications such as Jugantar and Sandhya, and were charged with sedition. Brahmabhandav 
Upadhyay, a Hindu newspaper editor who helped Tagore establish his school at Shantiniketan, 
was imprisoned and the first to die in British custody in the twentieth century struggle for self-rule.</FONT>
