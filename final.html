<FONT size = "4" face = "calibri"><P>In 1937, provincial elections were held and the Congress came to power in seven of the eleven provinces. This was a strong indicator of the Indian 
people's support for complete self-rule.</P>
<P>Especially during the Battle of Britain in 1940, Gandhi resisted calls for massive civil disobedience movements that came from within as well as outside his party, 
stating he did not seek India's self-rule out of the ashes of a destroyed Britain. In 1942, the Congress launched the Quit India movement. There was some violence but
<IMG src ="Cripps.jpg" align = "right" height = "220" width = "146"> the Raj cracked down and arrested tens of thousands of Congress leaders, including all the main 
national and provincial figures. They were not released until the end of the war was in sight in 1945.</P>
<P>The self-rule movement saw the rise of three movements: The first of these, the Kakori conspiracy (9 August 1925) was led by Indian youth under the leadership of 
Pandit Ram Prasad Bismil; second was the Azad Hind movement led by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose which saw its inception early in the war and joined Germany and Japan to 
fight Britain; the third one saw its inception in August 1942, was led by Lal Bahadur Shastri and reflected the common man resulting the failure of the Cripps' 
mission to reach a consensus with the Indian political leadership over the transfer of power after the war.</P>

<LI><H2>Azad Hind Fauj (Indian National Army)</H2>
<P>The entry of India into the war was strongly opposed by Subhas Chandra Bose, who had been elected President of the Congress in 1938 and 1939, but later resigned 
due to differences in opinion with Gandhi. After resignation he<IMG src ="SCB.jpg" align = "right"> formed his own wing separated from the mainstream congress 
leadership known as Forward bloc which was the centre of ex-congressmen with socialist views; however he remained emotionally attached with him for the remainder of 
his life. Bose then founded the All India Forward Bloc. In 1940, a year after war broke out, the British had put Bose under house arrest in Calcutta. However, he 
escaped and made his way through Afghanistan to Nazi Germany to seek Hitler and Mussolini's help for raising an army to fight the British. The Free India Legion 
comprising Erwin Rommel's Indian POWs was formed. However, in light of Germany's changing fortunes, a German land invasion of India became untenable and Hitler advised 
Bose to go to Japan and arranged for a submarine. Bose was ferried to Japanese Southeast Asia, where he formed the Azad Hind Government, a Provisional Free Indian 
Government in exile, and reorganised the Indian National Army composed of Indian POWs and volunteering Indian expatriates in South-East Asia, with the help of the Japanese. 
Its aim was to reach India as a fighting force that would build on public resentment to inspire revolts among Indian soldiers to defeat the British raj.
The INA was to see action against the allies, including the British Indian Army, in the forests of Arakan, Burma and in Assam, laying siege on Imphal and Kohima 
with the Japanese 15th Army. During the war, the Andaman and Nicobar islands were captured by the Japanese and handed over by them to the INA.The INA failed owing to 
disrupted logistics, poor supplies from the Japanese, and lack of training. It surrendered unconditionally to the British in Singapore in 1945. Bose, however, 
attempted to escape to Japanese-held Manchuria in an attempt to escape to the Soviet Union, marking the end of the entire Azad Hind movement.</P>
<LI><H2>Quit India Movement</H2>
<P>The Quit India Movement (Bharat Chhodo Andolan) or the August Movement<IMG src = "QUITIN.jpg" align = "right"> was a civil disobedience movement in India which 
commenced on 8 August 1942 in response to Gandhi's call for immediate self-rule by Indians and against sending Indians to World War II. He asked all teachers to leave 
their schools, and other Indians to leave their respective jobs and take part in this movement. Due to Gandhi's political influence, his request was followed by a 
massive proportion of the population. In addition, the INC led the Quit India Movement to demand the British to leave India and to transfer the political power to INC.
During the movement, Gandhi and his followers continued to use non-violence against British rule. This movement was where Gandhi gave his famous message, 
"Do or Die!", and this message spread towards the Indian community. In addition, this movement was addressed directly to women as "disciplined soldiers of Indian 
freedom" and they had to keep the war for independence to go on (against British rule).
Overall, the Quit India Movement turned out to be not very successful and only lasted until 1943. It drew away from Gandhi's tactic of non-violence; it eventually 
became a rebellious act without any real leader.</P>
<LI><H2>Sovereignty and Partition of India</H2>
<P>On 3 June 1947, Viscount Louis Mountbatten, the last British Governor-General of <IMG src = "POI.jpg" align = "right"> India, announced the partitioning of British 
India into India and Pakistan. With the speedy passage through the British Parliament of the Indian Independence Act 1947, at 11:57 on 14 August 1947 Pakistan was 
declared a separate nation, and at 12:02, just after midnight, on 15 August 1947, India also became a sovereign and democratic nation. Eventually, 15 August became the 
Independence Day for India, due to the ending of British rule over India. On that 15 August, both Pakistan and India had the right to remain in or remove themselves 
from the British Commonwealth. In 1949, India decided to remain in the commonwealth.</P>
<P>Violent clashes between Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims followed. Prime Minister<IMG src = "POI2.jpg" align = "right"> Nehru and deputy prime minister Sardar Vallabhbhai 
Patel invited Mountbatten to continue as Governor General of India. He was replaced in June 1948 by Chakravarti Rajagopalachari.</P>
